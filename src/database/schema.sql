A música é confessional e direta, expressando raiva, mágoa e a dificuldade de perdoar.

Don''t say sorry now And thanks to you, I, I can''t love right I get nice guys and villainize them Read their texts like they''re having sex right now Scared I''ll find out that it''s true And if I do, then I blame you For every worst that I assume When I''m 45, someone calls me their wife And he fucks our lives in one selfish night Don''t think I''ll find forgiveness as fast as mom did And, God, I love you, but you''re such a dipshit Please, fucking fix this ''Cause you were all I looked up to Now I can''t even look at you (I mean, as they say in Chicago) (He had it coming)'),
('Vicious', 'Em Vicious, Sabrina Carpenter reflete sobre a dor de amar alguém que aparentava ser perfeito para os outros, mas era manipulador em privado.

You like a certain type of woman Who''s smart, but neglects intuition When you''re insecure, could be me, could be her You just run to whoever is winning Said that it was me and you for life Now you''re kinda acting like I died Oh, you''re so vicious Love me then pretend you didn''t Crush my heart and wreck my image Why you gotta be so, so, so Oh, you''re so vicious Love me then pretend you didn''t Half of me just can''t resist it Why you gotta be so vicious? Oh, no Why you gotta be so— Oh, oh Why you gotta be so vicious?

('Tornado Warnings', 'Em Tornado Warnings, Sabrina Carpenter usa o alerta de tornado como metáfora para ignorar sinais claros de um relacionamento ruim. A música mostra como ela nega a própria realidade até para a terapeuta para evitar encarar a dor, dizendo que nem viu a pessoa ou que nada aconteceu. Também revela seu desgaste emocional ao admitir que precisa de tempo para pensar em si mesma, já que está tão obcecada pelo outro que não consegue se ouvir. A canção combina vulnerabilidade e autocrítica ao retratar o caos interno de quem insiste em ignorar o óbvio.', 1, 1, '3:24', 'We were never in the park Talkin'' on a see-saw teetering With our feelings in the dark Ignoring tornado warnings He didn''t hold me in his arms We didn''t stumble over the pages Of our relationship arc Ignoring tornado warnings Don''t understand how quickly we get Right back in our rhythm without missing a step And logically the last thing I should have on my mind But I want you there sometimes I guess maybe that''s why I''m lying to my therapist I keep saying things like: I never saw him and we never kissed Now I think somehow in my mind if I could convince him If he doesn''t see it, then maybe it doesn''t exist I think he''s onto me every time I say I''m over that son of a bitch I''m lying to my therapist I deserve an hour in a week To focus on my thoughts Not so obsessed with yours I can''t hear myself speak I deserve my own consideration Sometimes I wish I kept Some of my feelings in the basement So I''d still have some left Don''t understand how quickly we get Right back in our rhythm without missing a step And logically the last thing I should have on my mind But I want you there sometimes I guess maybe that''s why I''m lying to my therapist I keep saying things like: I never saw him and we never kissed Now I think somehow in my mind if I could convince him If he doesn''t see it, then maybe it doesn''t exist I think he''s onto me every time I say I''m over that son of a bitch I''m lying to my therapist I''ll drive you home, you drive me crazy But that''s not gonna stop me I''ll call you out, you call me baby But that''s not gonna stop me From lying to my therapist I keep saying things like: I never saw him and we never kissed Now I think somehow in my mind if I could convince him If he doesn''t see it, then maybe it doesn''t exist I think he''s onto me every time I say I''m over that son of a bitch I''m lying to my therapist'),
('because i liked a boy', 'Em because i liked a boy, Sabrina Carpenter mostra como um romance simples acabou gerando uma onda de ataques e julgamentos desproporcionais. Enquanto para ela a relação era leve, as redes sociais transformaram tudo em um caos, levando-a a ser rotulada e até a receber ameaças. A música expõe sua frustração por perder o controle da própria narrativa e ser definida pelos outros (só porque gostou de um garoto). Com ironia e vulnerabilidade, Sabrina critica o linchamento virtual e o impacto emocional de carregar rótulos injustos.', 1, 1, '3:16', 'I said I wanted Thin Mints And you said you knew a guy You showed up with a boombox And stars in your eyes Who knew cuddling on trampolines Could be so reckless? We bonded over Black Eyed Peas And complicated exes Fell so deeply into it It was all so innocent Now I''m a homewrecker, I''m a slut I got death threats filling up semi trucks Tell me who I am Guess I don''t have a choice All because I liked— I''m a hot topic on your tongue I''m a rebound gettin'' round Stealin'' from the young Tell me who I am Guess I don''t have a choice All because I liked a boy (Ooh, ooh) I''m not catastrophizing Everything''s derailing Was only tryna hold you close While your heart was failing It''s not internet illusion Just two kids going through it You said I''m too late to be your first love But I''ll always be your favorite Now I''m a homewrecker, I''m a slut I got death threats filling up semi trucks Tell me who I am Guess I don''t have a choice All because I liked— I''m a hot topic on your tongue I''m a rebound gettin'' round Stealin'' from the young Tell me who I am Guess I don''t have a choice All because I liked a boy (Ah, ah, ah) All because I liked a boy Fell so deeply into it It was all so innocent Dating boys with exes No, I wouldn''t recommend it I''m a homewrecker, I''m a slut I got death threats filling up semi trucks Tell me who I am Guess I don''t have a choice All because I liked a boy And all of this for what?

('Already Over', 'Em Already Over, Sabrina Carpenter retrata como o apego emocional mantém vivo um relacionamento que já deveria ter acabado. A música mostra o ciclo de recaídas, promessas quebradas e encontros repetidos, revelando a dificuldade de se desligar de alguém que ainda exerce forte influência. O refrão destaca o dilema entre razão e sentimento, que expõem a vulnerabilidade e o medo de perder o outro. No fim, a canção deixa claro que, mesmo após um término, o apego persiste e é isso que torna fechar a porta quase impossível.', 1, 1, '2:51', 'We been talkin'' for hours ''Bout how we shouldn''t talk for hours on end Kissin'' after a conversation About how we''d probably be better off as friends Same time here next weekend Say we won''t do this again Make me fall where I stand Only like you can Yeah, I say I''m done, but I''m still confused How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?

A música também expõe a insegurança de perceber que deixou de ser prioridade, especialmente em (I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me). Sabrina revela a dor de cair na lista de prioridades do outro enquanto continua inventando desculpas para ele. No fim, a canção mistura vulnerabilidade e honestidade ao retratar o sentimento de ainda pensar na pessoa em tudo, mesmo sabendo que não recebe o mesmo em troca.', 1, 1, '4:04', 'You used a fork once It turns out forks are fucking everywhere There''s no hiding from the thought of us I got ways to find you anywhere We sat on the roof once Conversation took us everywhere And we talked until the Sun came up I wish we stayed just like we were up there I consider you, I''m not trying to It doesn''t matter whether or not I want to I can''t help it, it''s a habit Your corner in my mind is well established Ah, I, I wonder how many things you think about Before you get to me I wonder how many things you wanna do You think I''m in between I feel myself falling further down your priorities And I still make excuses for you constantly I wonder how many things you think about Before, before you get to me Remember when you left once?

('bet u wanna', 'Em bet u wanna, Sabrina Carpenter usa a ironia para mostrar o arrependimento de quem antes a negligenciou. Com um tom provocativo, ela destaca que o ex agora sente falta e enfrenta a própria solidão, enquanto ela segue confiante. Versos como (Bet you wanna touch me now) revelam o desejo tardio dele, e trechos como (Feel the way it feels when you don''t have control of who I''m holding) expõem o ciúme e a perda de controle. O riso final — Haha — reforça que Sabrina superou o passado e se diverte com a situação. A mistura de R&B e funk pop amplifica essa atmosfera segura, sensual e autossuficiente.', 1, 1, '3:11', 'Told me, told me I''m your only It''s all unfolding, babe Slowly, slowly Lies you sold me All saw the light of day (day) You''ve been wastin'' time On the other side If you''re satisfied, touché Now you say you hate All the empty space And if you could go back, you''d stay Didn''t think about it when you let me down Hurts to see me out of your reach Bet you wanna touch me now It''s cold out there Let me know what you found (let me know what you found) Bet you wanna love me now Bet you wanna love me now Chase me, chase me That''s right, baby, yeah Feel the way it feels When you don''t have control Of who I''m holding Is it feeding all your fear?

As we''re lying on the couch The moment I could see it Yes, yes, I can see it now Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man''s careful daughter You are the best thing that''s ever been mine Flash forward and we''re taking on the world together And there''s a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I''m guarded You say we''ll never make my parents'' mistakes But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes, this is what I thought about Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?

A imagem da tempestade contra um castelo de cartas mostra como ela se sente vulnerável diante de alguém que a atrai intensamente.

('Dear John', 'Em Dear John, Taylor Swift transforma um relacionamento marcado por manipulação emocional em um desabafo cru e doloroso. O verso Don''t you think nineteen''s too young… evidencia não só a diferença de idade, mas também o desequilíbrio de poder que tornou a experiência profundamente traumática. A música funciona como uma carta aberta em que Swift confronta diretamente o comportamento do ex-parceiro, revelando como suas jogadas sombrias deixaram cicatrizes. É uma das faixas mais vulneráveis e transparentes da cantora, marcada por sinceridade e autorreflexão.', 3, 7, '6:45', 'Long were the nights When my days once revolved around you Counting my footsteps Praying the floor won''t fall through again And my mother accused me of losing my mind But I swore I was fine You paint me a blue sky And go back and turn it to rain And I lived in your chess game But you changed the rules every day Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight Well, I stopped picking up And this song is to let you know why Dear John I see it all now that you''re gone Don''t you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I should''ve known Well, maybe it''s me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it''s you and your sick need To give love then take it away And you''ll add my name To your long list of traitors who don''t understand And I''ll look back in regret How I ignored when they said: Run as fast as you can Dear John I see it all now that you''re gone Don''t you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John I see it all now, it was wrong Don''t you think nineteen''s too young to be played By your dark twisted games when I loved you so? I should''ve known You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you''ve run dry have tired, lifeless eyes ''Cause you burned them out But I took your matches before fire could catch me So don''t look now I''m shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town, ooh Dear John I see it all now that you''re gone Don''t you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I see it all now that you''re gone Don''t you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress wrote you a song You should''ve known You should''ve known Don''t you think I was too young? You should''ve known'),
('Mean', 'Em Mean, Taylor Swift transforma ataques pessoais em uma declaração de força e resiliência. As metáforas de palavras como facas e espadas mostram o quanto as críticas a machucaram, especialmente após a repercussão negativa de sua performance no Grammy de 2010. Inspirada por comentários duros de críticos como Bob Lefsetz, a música adota um tom firme, deixando claro que, apesar da crueldade alheia, Swift escolhe crescer, evoluir e seguir em frente. É um hino de superação que reafirma que a maldade dos outros não define o próprio valor.', 3, 7, '3:58', 'You, with your words like knives And swords and weapons that you use against me You, have knocked me off my feet again Got me feeling like I''m nothing You, with your voice like nails On a chalkboard, calling me out when I''m wounded You, picking on the weaker man Well, you can take me down With just one single blow But you don''t know what you don''t know Someday I''ll be living in a big old city And all you''re ever gonna be is mean Someday I''ll be big enough so you can''t hit me And all you''re ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?

('The Story of Us', 'Em The Story of Us, Taylor Swift retrata como a falta de comunicação e o orgulho podem transformar um relacionamento ainda cheio de sentimentos em uma trama de distância e mal-entendidos. As metáforas literárias como I don’t know what page you’re on e next chapter reforçam a ideia de que o romance, antes promissor, virou um livro confuso, sem direção. A inspiração veio de um episódio real: Swift encontrou um ex em um evento público e, mesmo com o clima tenso e cheio de coisas não ditas, ambos fingiram estar bem enquanto evitavam qualquer contato direto. O resultado é uma música que captura perfeitamente a frustração de amar alguém com quem já não se sabe mais como conversar.', 3, 7, '4:27', 'I used to think one day we''d tell the story of us How we met and the sparks flew instantly And people would say: They''re the lucky ones I used to know my place was the spot next to you Now I''m searching the room for an empty seat ''Cause lately I don''t even know what page you''re on Oh, a simple complication Miscommunications lead to fallout So many things that I wish you knew So many walls up I can''t break through Now I''m standing alone in a crowded room and we''re not speaking And I''m dying to know: Is it killing you like it''s killing me, yeah?

('Never Grow Up', 'Never Grow Up reflete a saudade da infância e o choque de amadurecer.

('Enchanted', 'Enchanted captura o encanto de um encontro inesperado e profundamente marcante. A palavra wonderstruck, usada no verso I''m wonderstruck, blushing all the way home, veio de um e-mail real que Adam Young (Owl City) enviou a Taylor, tornando a canção ainda mais pessoal.

('Better Than Revenge', 'Em Better Than Revenge, Taylor Swift assume um tom afiado e sarcástico para lidar com a dor de uma traição. No verso She should keep in mind, there is nothing I do better than revenge, ela transforma mágoa em provocação, deixando claro que não ficará passiva diante da situação. A metáfora He was a moth to the flame, she was holding the matches reforça a ideia de sedução intencional e destrutiva, destacando o clima de rivalidade que permeia a música.', 3, 7, '3:40', 'Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Time for a little revenge!)

('Innocent', 'Em Innocent, Taylor Swift transforma o episódio do VMA de 2009 em uma reflexão sobre perdão e crescimento. Ao cantar 32 and still growing up now, ela faz uma referência direta a Kanye West, mas sem hostilidade. Em vez disso, transmite a ideia de que erros não definem uma pessoa como resume o verso who you are is not what you did. A música reforça que amadurecer é um processo contínuo e que todos merecem a chance de recomeçar.', 3, 7, '5:01', 'I guess you really did it this time Left yourself in your war path Lost your balance on a tightrope Lost your mind trying to get it back Wasn''t it easier in your lunchbox days?

('Last Kiss', 'Em Last Kiss, Taylor Swift transforma o fim de um relacionamento em um retrato delicado de memória e saudade. A data mencionada na canção, 9 de julho, funciona como um marcador emocional ligado ao término com Joe Jonas, tornando-se um ponto fixo de lembrança para fãs e para a própria artista. Outro detalhe simbólico é a introdução de 27 segundos, que ecoa a duração da ligação em que o término aconteceu curta, brusca e inesperada. Esses elementos tornam a música especialmente íntima, mostrando como pequenos instantes podem carregar grande significado após uma separação.', 3, 7, '6:09', 'I still remember the look on your face Lit through the darkness at 1:58 The words that you whispered for just us to know You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

('Ours', 'Em Ours, Taylor Swift mostra como críticas e julgamentos externos se tornam irrelevantes diante de um amor baseado em autenticidade. As características que os outros veem como imperfeições são exatamente o que torna o parceiro especial aos olhos dela.

('Superman', 'Em Superman, Taylor Swift usa a imagem do super-herói para representar alguém admirável, mas sempre distante. A música nasceu de um comentário real que ela fez ao ver uma pessoa importante indo embora como se estivesse voando para longe. Essa metáfora destaca a sensação de impotência diante da ausência de quem se ama, mostrando que, mesmo quando a rotina da pessoa é comum, o impacto emocional é grande.

('When Emma Falls in Love', 'Em When Emma Falls in Love, Taylor Swift retrata Emma como alguém que equilibra luz e fragilidade. Embora seja vista como radiante e forte, ela enfrenta o amor com certa cautela, revelando camadas mais profundas de insegurança e sensibilidade. A comparação com figuras grandiosas, como Cleópatra, reforça sua força interior, enquanto a ideia de que ela poderia mudar até os “garotos problemáticos” destaca seu poder de influência emocional. A música celebra essa mistura de delicadeza e determinação que torna Emma tão admirada pela narradora.', 3, 7, '4:12', 'When Emma falls in love she paces the floor Closes the blinds and locks the door When Emma falls in love she calls up her mom Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong She waits and takes her time ''Cause little Miss Sunshine always thinks it''s gonna rain When Emma falls in love I know that boy will never be the same ''Cause she''s the kind of book that you can''t put down Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town And all the bad boys would be good boys If they only had a chance to love her And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her When Emma falls in love it''s all on her face Hangs in the air like stars in outer space When Emma falls in love she disappears And we all just laugh after seeing it all these years When Emma falls apart, it''s when she''s alone She takes on the pain and bears it on her own ''Cause when Emma falls in love she''s in it for keeps She won''t walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave ''Cause she''s the kind of book that you can''t put down Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town And all the bad boys would be good boys If they only had a chance to love her And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her Well, she''s so New York when she''s in LA She won''t lose herself in love the way that I did ''Cause she''ll call you out, she''ll put you in your place When Emma falls in love, I''m learning Emma met a boy with eyes like a man Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand Now he''ll be her shelter when it rains Little does he know his whole world is about to change ''Cause she''s the kind of book that you can''t put down Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town And all the bad boys would be good boys If they only had a chance to love her And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her'),
('I Can See You', 'Em I Can See You, Taylor Swift explora um desejo carregado de mistério, construindo a narrativa como se fosse uma operação secreta entre dois envolvidos que não podem ser descobertos. O uso de imagens como terno, gravata e missão clandestina cria uma estética de espionagem, reforçada pelos vocais que lembram comunicação por rádio. Esse clima levou fãs a especularem sobre a inspiração na equipe de segurança da cantora, já que a música mistura tensão, observação silenciosa e a sensação de um romance que precisa permanecer oculto. A temática inteira gira em torno desse jogo de esconder e revelar, que dá à faixa um ar provocativo e conspiratório.', 3, 7, '4:33', 'Uh-uh, uh, uh You brush past me in the hallway And you don''t think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?

('Castles Crumbling', 'Em Castles Crumbling (feat. Hayley Williams), Taylor Swift transforma a imagem de um castelo desabando em metáfora para a perda de confiança e a sensação de desmoronamento público após momentos traumáticos de sua carreira. A música reflete diretamente o impacto emocional do VMA de 2009 quando Kanye West interrompeu seu discurso e a consequente insegurança que surgiu dali. A ideia de que o público antes celebrava sua presença, mas agora parece julgá-la, traduz a percepção de queda e vulnerabilidade.

A canção mostra que a presença de alguém especial ligada ao relacionamento com Travis Kelce funciona como um apoio que a impede de “afundar”, revelando a força curativa do amor.', 3, 9, '3:47', 'I heard you calling on the megaphone You wanna see me all alone As legend has it you, are quite the pyro You light the match to watch it blow And if you''d never come for me I might''ve drowned in the melancholy I swore my loyalty to me (me), myself (myself) and I (I) Right before you lit my sky up (All that time) I sat alone in my tower You were just honing your powers Now I can see it all (see it all) (Late one night) you dug me out of my grave and Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia (Ophelia) Keep it one hundred on the land (land), the sea (sea), the sky Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes Don''t care where the hell you been (been) ''cause now (now) you''re mine It''s ''bout to be the sleepless night you''ve been dreaming of The fate of Ophelia The eldest daughter of a nobleman Ophelia lived in fantasy But love was a cold bed full of scorpions The venom stole her sanity (yeah) And if you''d never come for me (come for me) I might''ve lingered in purgatory You wrap around me like a chain (chain), a crown (crown), a vine (vine) Pulling me into the fire (All that time) I sat alone in my tower You were just honing your powers Now I can see it all (see it all) (Late one night) you dug me out of my grave and Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia (Ophelia) Keep it one hundred on the land (land), the sea (sea), the sky Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes Don''t care where the hell you been (been) ''cause now (now) you''re mine It''s ''bout to be the sleepless night you''ve been dreaming of The fate of Ophelia ''Tis locked inside my memory and only you possess the key No longer drowning and deceived All because you came for me Locked inside my memory and only you possess the key No longer drowning and deceived All because you came for me (All that time) I sat alone in my tower You were just honing your powers Now I can see it all (see it all) (Late one night) you dug me out of my grave and Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia (Ophelia) Keep it one hundred on the land (land), the sea (sea) (the sea), the sky Pledge allegiance to your hands (your hands), your team, your vibes Don''t care where the hell you been (been) (you''ve been) ''cause now (now) (''cause now) you''re mine It''s ''bout to be the sleepless night you''ve been dreaming of The fate of Ophelia You saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia'),
('Elizabeth Taylor', 'A música faz um paralelo entre a vulnerabilidade de Taylor Swift e a imagem elegante, porém frágil, de Elizabeth Taylor. A referência aos olhos violetas mostra que até figuras glamorosas enfrentam dores profundas por amor. A frase sobre ter sido número um mas nunca ter dois reflete a ironia de alcançar grande sucesso, mas ainda sentir falta de uma parceria verdadeira, ecoando a própria trajetória de Elizabeth Taylor, marcada pela fama, relacionamentos intensos e a busca constante por um amor duradouro.', 3, 9, '3:29', 'Elizabeth Taylor Do you think it''s forever? That view of Portofino was on my mind When you called me at the Plaza Athénée Ooh-ooh, oftentimes it doesn''t feel so glamorous to be me All the right guys promised they''d stay Under bright lights, they withered away, but you bloom Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why) And if your letters ever said: Goodbye I''d cry my eyes violet Elizabeth Taylor, tell me for real Do you think it''s forever?

All my white diamonds and lovers are forever Don''t you ever end up anything but mine, oh-oh-oh'),
('Opalite', 'A música usa a opalita como metáfora para mostrar que a felicidade pode ser construída a partir de experiências difíceis. Assim como a pedra é produzida artificialmente, o amor retratado por Taylor Swift também nasce de escolhas, crescimento e cura. A referência à pedra de nascimento de Travis Kelce reforça o vínculo pessoal da canção. A transição da noite de ônix para um céu opalita simboliza a passagem da dor para uma fase de esperança e renovação ao lado de um novo amor.', 3, 9, '3:56', 'I had a bad habit Of missing lovers past My brother used to call it Eating out of the trash It''s never gonna last I thought my house was haunted I used to live with ghosts And all the perfect couples Said: When you know, you know And: When you don''t, you don''t And all of the foes and all of the friends (ha-ha) Have seen it before, they''ll see it again (ha-ha) Life is a song, it ends when it ends I was wrong But my mama told me it''s alright You were dancing through the lightning strikes Sleepless in the onyx night But now the sky is opalite Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my Lord Never made no one like you before You had to make your own sunshine But now the sky is opalite Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh You couldn''t understand it Why you felt alone You were in it for real She was in her phone And you were just a pose And don''t we try to love love?

('Father Figure', 'A música apresenta Taylor Swift em uma posição de força, assumindo o papel de mentora dominante e até intimidadora. Usando linguagem agressiva e referências a figuras de autoridade como Logan Roy, ela desafia expectativas de gênero e ironiza a masculinidade típica de ambientes poderosos. Essa postura também dialoga com sua própria experiência na indústria musical, marcada por disputas e atitudes machistas, especialmente no conflito envolvendo seus masters.', 3, 9, '3:33', 'When I found you, you were young Wayward, lost in the cold Pulled up to you in the Jag'' Turned your rags into gold The winding road leads to the château You remind me of a younger me I saw potential I''ll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor I can make deals with the devil because my dick''s bigger This love is pure profit, just step into my office I dry your tears with my sleeve Leave it with me I protect the family Leave it with me I protect the family I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain Said: They want to see you rise, they don''t want you to reign I showed you all the tricks of the trade All I ask for is your loyalty My dear protégé I''ll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor I can make deals with the devil because my dick''s bigger This love is pure profit, just step into my office They''ll know your name in the streets Leave it with me I protect the family (Ooh) I saw a change in you (saw a change, saw a change, yeah) My dear boy, they don''t make loyalty like they used to (la-la, like they used to) Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions Which led to misguided visions That to fulfill your dreams You had to get rid of me I protect the family I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor You made a deal with this devil, turns out my dick''s bigger You want a fight, you found it, I got the place surrounded You''ll be sleeping with the fishes Before you know, you''re drowning Whose portrait''s on the mantle?

('Eldest Daughter', 'A música aborda o peso das expectativas colocadas sobre filhas mais velhas, que muitas vezes precisam parecer fortes mesmo quando estão emocionalmente exaustas. Taylor Swift mostra o contraste entre a imagem de autossuficiência e a vulnerabilidade silenciosa de quem tenta sempre corresponder ao que esperam dela. A metáfora do cordeiro para o abate que se transforma em loba simboliza como as primogênitas aprendem a se proteger construindo uma aparência de força, mesmo carregando pressões e dores internas.', 3, 9, '4:07', 'Everybody''s so punk on the internet Everyone''s unbothered till they''re not Every joke''s just trolling and memes Sad as it seems, apathy is hot Everybody''s cutthroat in the comments Every single hot take is cold as ice When you found me, I said I was busy That was a lie I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness I''ve been dying just from trying to seem cool But I''m not a bad bitch And this isn''t savage But I''m never gonna let you down I''m never gonna leave you out So many traitors Smooth operators But I''m never gonna break that vow I''m never gonna leave you Now, now, now You know, the last time I laughed this hard was On the trampoline in somebody''s backyard I must''ve been about eight or nine That was the night I fell off and broke my arm Pretty soon I learned cautious discretion When your first crush crushes something kind When I said I don''t believe in marriage That was a lie Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire But I''m not a bad bitch And this isn''t savage But I''m never gonna let you down I''m never gonna leave you out So many traitors Smooth operators But I''m never gonna break that vow (never gonna break that vow) I''m never gonna leave you Now, now, now (Never gonna break that vow) mm-mm (Never gonna leave you) Now, now I''m never gonna leave you now'),
('Ruin The Friendship', 'A música retrata o arrependimento de não ter transformado uma amizade de juventude em algo maior antes de perder essa pessoa para sempre. As lembranças simples do dia a dia, como dirigir por ruas conhecidas, assistir a um jogo no carro do irmão ou dançar no baile de formatura, ganham um peso emocional enorme quando vistas como chances que nunca foram aproveitadas. A canção mostra como a morte do amigo faz emergir a dor das oportunidades perdidas e o desejo de que algo tivesse acontecido enquanto ainda havia tempo.', 3, 9, '3:41', 'Glistening grass from September rain Grey overpass full of neon names You drive, mm-mm Eighty-five, mm-mm Gallatin Road and the lakeside beach Watching the game from your brother''s Jeep Your smile, mm-mm Miles wide And it was not an invitation Should''ve kissed you anyway Should''ve kissed you anyway And it was not convenient, no But your girlfriend was away Should''ve kissed you anyway, hey Shiny wood floors underneath my feet Disco ball makes everything look cheap Have fun, mm-mm It''s prom, mm-mm Witted corsage dangles from my wrist Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse And see, mm-mm You looking at me And it was not an invitation But as the 50 Cent song played (song played) Should''ve kissed you anyway (anyway) And it was not (it was not) convenient (convenient), no Would''ve been the best mistake Should''ve kissed you anyway, ayy Don''t make it awkward in second period Might piss your ex off Lately we''ve been good Staying friends is safe Doesn''t mean you should Don''t make it awkward in second period Might piss your ex off Lately we''ve been good Staying friends is safe Doesn''t mean you should When I left school, I lost track of you Abigail called me with the bad news Goodbye And we''ll never know why It was not an invitation But I flew home anyway With so much left to say It was not convenient, no But I whispered at the grave Should''ve kissed you anyway, ooh And it was not (it was not) an invitation (invitation), oh Should''ve kissed you anyway (anyway) Should''ve kissed you anyway (anyway), anyway And it was not My advice is always: Ruin the friendship Better that than regret it for all time Should''ve kissed you anyway And my advice is: Always answer the question Better that than to ask it all your life Should''ve kissed you anyway Should''ve kissed you anyway'),
('Actually Romantic', 'A música transforma ataques e provocações em sinais de atenção, brincando com a ideia de que a rivalidade pode ser uma forma distorcida de admiração. Taylor Swift inverte a lógica dos diss tracks ao retratar a agressora como alguém obcecada por ela, destacando o quanto essa pessoa dedica tempo e energia à sua imagem. O tom irônico mostra que cada indireta soa quase como um gesto de carinho, revelando que a suposta inimiga presta mais atenção nela do que qualquer outra pessoa.', 3, 9, '2:44', 'I heard you call me boring Barbie when the coke''s got you brave High-fived my ex and then you said you''re glad he ghosted me Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face Some people might be offended But it''s actually sweet All the time you''ve spent on me It''s honestly wild All the effort you''ve put in It''s actually romantic I really got to hand it to you No man has ever loved me like you do Hadn''t thought of you in a long time But you keep sending me funny valentines And I know you think it comes off vicious But it''s precious, adorable Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse That''s how much it hurts How many times has your boyfriend said: Why are we always talking about her?

('Wi$h Li$t', 'A música contrasta os desejos extravagantes ligados à fama com o verdadeiro anseio da narradora por uma vida simples e familiar. Taylor Swift usa referências irônicas a luxos e status para mostrar que nada disso a atrai tanto quanto a ideia de ter uma rotina tranquila. O sonho recorrente de uma garagem com uma cesta de basquete simboliza esse desejo por estabilidade e construção de um lar, além de trazer um tom íntimo ligado ao relacionamento com Travis Kelce.', 3, 9, '3:28', 'They want that yacht life, under chopper blades They want those bright lights and Balenci'' shades And a fat ass with a baby face They want it all They want that complex female character They want that critical smash Palme d''Or And an Oscar on their bathroom floor They want it all And they should have what they want They deserve what they want Hope they get what they want I just want you, ooh Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do Wow, got me dreaming ''bout a driveway with a basketball hoop Boss up, settle down Got a wish (wish) list (list), I just want you They want that freedom, living off the grid They want those three dogs that they call their kids And that good surf, no hypocrites They want it all They want a contract with Real Madrid They want that spring break that was fucking lit And then that video taken off the internet They want it all And they should have what they want They deserve what they want I hope they get what I want I just want you (you), ooh (yeah) Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do (ooh) Wow, got me dreaming ''bout a driveway with a basketball hoop Boss up, settle down Got a wish (wish) list (list) I made wishes on all of the stars Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot I thought I had it right once, twice (twice), but I did not You caught me off my guard I hope I get what I want (get what) ''Cause I know what I want I just want you (baby) Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (got ''em looking like you) you We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do Wow, got me dreaming ''bout a driveway with a basketball hoop Boss up, settle down Got a wish (wish) list (list) I just want you, ooh (I want you) Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (you) you We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do (yeah) Wow, (and now you) got me dreaming ''bout a driveway with a basketball hoop Boss up, settle down Got a wish (wish) list (list), I just want you'),
('Wood', 'A música Wood usa o humor e a simbologia das superstições para falar de intimidade, transformando elementos como magic wand e redwood tree em metáforas que sugerem desejo e atração. Ao mencionar New Heights of manhood, Taylor Swift faz um jogo de palavras com o podcast New Heights, apresentado por Travis Kelce, aproximando a letra do contexto do relacionamento dos dois.

Termos carinhosos que já foram usados de forma sarcástica ou depreciativa contra ela especialmente em ambientes hostis e marcados por julgamentos ganham um novo valor emocional.

('The Life of a Showgirl', 'Em The Life of a Showgirl, Taylor Swift usa a personagem Kitty uma artista deslumbrante e fictícia para refletir sobre os bastidores do entretenimento e suas contradições. A música mistura ironia e confissão ao mostrar como o glamour esconde exploração, solidão e a pressão por uma imagem perfeita.
